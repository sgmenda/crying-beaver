# Crying Beaver

`crying-beaver` is an illustration of a beaver sobbing with plain eyes while
holding a bottle of maple syrup, with a canadian flag in the background.

`crying-beaver-pleading` is a variant with pleading eyes instead of plain eyes.

`crying-beaver-square` is a variant with square dimensions (for use as custom emoji.)
